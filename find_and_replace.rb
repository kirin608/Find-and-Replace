# Create a script where a user can find and replace words in a string. 
# The method in action will look something like "Hello world".find_and_replace("world", "universe").
#  The result of would be "Hello universe".

# Do first: Write the method so that it replaces whole words only, 
# as in the "hello world" example above. Make sure all your tests pass.

# Do second: Add to your method so that your method takes into account partial matches. 
# For example "I am walking my cat to the cathedral".find_and_replace("cat", "dog")
#  would return the silly phrase "I am walking my dog to the doghedral."

# Extra credit: Refactor your application so that it works with a .txt file. 
# You can use Rubyâ€™s File.open() method to open a file and then perform operations on it.
